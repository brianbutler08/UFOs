# UFO Sightings

# Overview

For this project, we created a website that diplayed information from a data set of UFO sightings. The site contains a brief introduction from the author, but its primary purpose is a set of filters that allow the user to explore the data based on criteria of interest to them.

The UFO sightings data set contained seven fields, five of which were developed into filters:

### Filtered
- Date of sighting
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape of object sighted

### Not filtered
- Duration of sighting
- Comments
